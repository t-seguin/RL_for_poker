Ideas: 

Each player is modelized as a neural network taking in the input layer the differents information 
- Of the game :
	Hole cards: Strength of the playerâ€™s private cards.
	Community cards: Cards on the board, affecting potential hand combinations.
	Pot odds: Ratio of the current bet to the potential winnings in the pot.
	Opponent actions: Betting patterns (e.g., raise, call, fold).
	Stack sizes: Remaining chips for all players.
	Position: Whether the player acts early, middle, or late in the betting round.
	Round stage: Pre-flop, flop, turn, or river.
- Of the wanted traits for the player
	Aggressiveness
	Bluff frequency
	Memory depth
	Learning rate
	Strategy profile
	Opponent tracking data

The output layer is the following four outputs :
	Fold
	Call
	Raise
	Bluff

Later on, we can consider those outputs that are more realistic but complicate the loss function :
	Fold
	Call
	Raise
	Amount


Loss function should : 
- evaluate how different is the behavior with the input traits. (Using bahavior evaluation function)
- variate regarding the win/loose amount


1 step = one hand played
